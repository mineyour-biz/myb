Sure, we know about the various coins and projects they support and that must provide some insight into who the people are. To get to the bottom of it, I assigned personality types to some of crypto's most prominent figures using the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI)</p><p> </p><h2><strong>Myers-Briggs (MBTI)</strong></h2><p> </p><p>For those who are unfamiliar with the MBTI, it's kind of like astrology for business people. It focuses on ranking where people fall in sixteen personality types, which help to explain how people interact with the world</p><p> </p><p>A staggering 80% of Fortune 500 companies rely on the MBTI to build stronger, more productive teams and optimize their company's profitability. Thus, knowing some of crypto's most prominent leaders' personality types could help you find your crypto tribe, build a stronger portfolio, and maximize your profitability</p><p> </p><p>Who should you trust? Who should you be suspicious of? And which one is most like you?</p><p> </p><h3><strong>ISTP: Jack Dorsey</strong></h3><p> </p><p>Rational, spontaneous, unpredictable, and enthusiastic. Jack Dorsey codifies what it means to be an ISTP. Maybe that's why Twitter's CEO “ a bitcoin fanboy “ hasn't lifted his company's outdated ban on crypto-related ads</p><p> </p><h3><strong>ISTJ: Nick Szabo</strong></h3><p> </p><p>Intensely private, yet highly-prolific, crypto enthusiasts have oft-credited Szabo with bitcoin's creation (despite Craig Wright's unsubstantiated claims). Typing Szabo was challenging because of the complete lack of personal information about him on the web. Be we quickly realized that clues to uncovering Szabo's personality type lay within the cryptographer's serious and professional disposition. Szabo's ISTJ traits include his political conservatism, calm and practical demeanor, and stubborn resistance to new ideas that he doesn't support</p><p> </p><h3><strong>ISFP: Roger Ver</strong></h3><p> </p><p>You might not suspect that a man with a nickname like "Bitcoin Jesus" would be an introvert, but Ver is. That's because Ver â€“ like all ISFPs â€“ is an introvert who doesn't seem like one. True to ISFP form, Ver frequently loses his temper and turns into a raging ego-monster during emotionally-fueled debates</p><p> </p><h3><strong>INFJ: Naval Ravikant</strong></h3><p> </p><p>AngelList's Naval is an INFJ to his core. The modern-day philosopher is enthusiastic, organized, and idealistic. His thoughts run deep, and he has a unique and profound way of looking at the world</p><p> </p><h3><strong>INTP: Vitalik Buterin</strong></h3><p> </p><p>You know you've met an INTP when you walk away feeling both enlightened and confused. Vitalik is a crazy-smart system's theorist who is attempting to solve large-scale world problems using universal patterns. Skeptical, independent, direct, and analytical, Ethereum's co-founder and frontman is every bit the INTP</p><p> </p><h3><strong>INTJ: Elon Musk</strong></h3><p> </p><p>Brilliant, decisive, determined, and sometimes short-sighted, Tesla and SpaceX's CEO is as arrogant and he is clueless with romance all traits of an INTJ</p><p> </p><h3><strong>ENFJ: Amber Baldet</strong></h3><p> </p><p>The "Madonna of Blockchain" is as charismatic and inspiring as can be. JP Morgan's former blockchain lead â€“ now CEO of Clovyr is excellent at relating complex technical information to diverse audiences. But like all ENFJs, Baldet may sometimes spread herself too thin</p><p> </p><h3><strong>ENFP: Brock Pierce</strong></h3><p> </p><p>Like any true ENFP, Pierce is a free-spirit. The people's billionaire is adept at using his natural charm and gift of communication to control his popularity. His ENFP qualities include: spontaneity, openness, and sociability</p><p> </p><h3><strong>ENTJ: C.Z. <em>(Changpeng Zhao)</em> Binance</strong></h3><p> </p><p>Don't let CZ's nice guy persona fool you. As the founder of the world's largest crypto exchange Binance, CZ is as decisive, strategic, and savage as any ENTJ. Sure, he's efficient, but how far will his typical ENTJ ruthlessness get him and his exchange? The sky is the limit</p><p> </p><h3><strong>ENTP: John McAfee</strong></h3><p> </p><p>The 2020 presidential long-shot John McAfee is quick-thinking, magnetic, and highly outspoken. But there's more to McAfee than his outlandish predictions for bitcoin's future dollar value. The bitcoin perma-bull personifies the ENTP with his creative and energetic nature, as well as his argumentativeness, impracticality, and insensitivity to others</p><p> </p><h3><strong>ESFP: Laura Shin</strong></h3><p> </p><p>Such a natural on her podcast Unchained, ESFP Laura Shin was born to entertain. Adaptable, expressive, and action-oriented, the journalist enjoys c=sharing her knowledge of blockchain and cryptocurrencies</p><p> </p><h3><strong>ESFJ: Craig Wright</strong></h3><p> </p><p>Popular and social, ESFJs like Dr. Wright universally hate when rules change. Maybe that's why he created BSV (and according to him the original bitcoin as well). Like others with his personality type, when Wright's feeling are hurt, he becomes aggressively defensive. Maybe that explains Wright's ongoing feuds with John McAfee and CZ Binance, among others. Like a true ESFJ, Wright is concerned with his social status, and it seems unlikely that someone with this trait would have pseudonymously created bitcoin. But, we suppose, time will tell</p><p> </p><h3><strong>ESTP: Charlie Lee</strong></h3><p> </p><p>Blockchain enthusiasts can all agree that Litecoin's creator Charlie Lee is difficult to decode. While many respect him for liquidating his LTC portfolio, others suspect he took advantage of his position by selling at the coin's all-time high. Having contradictory feelings toward an ESTP is very common. Outgoing, perceptive, and persuasive â€“ like other ESTPs Lee's determination and insolence may lead him into many risky endeavors</p><p> </p><h2><strong>Using the MBTI</strong></h2><p> </p><p>Although the MBTI isn't perfect, knowing prominent crypto figures' personality types can provide a window to help understand why each person thinks and acts the way they do. It might even help to determine which of these leaders we can trust, and whose tips we should ignore</p><p> </p><p><em>Did we leave someone out? And what's your MBTI?
